- **Unordered lists** (- or *) for features, characteristics, or collections
- [External links]() and internal navigation links as specified

## 3. Enhanced Structural Elements:

- Local legends and traditional stories

## 5. MANDATORY Linking Rule:

**Example:** [Pemayangtse Monastery](/monastery/pemayangtse-monastery)
*Only use links provided in the context.*
